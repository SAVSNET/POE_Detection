Pseudomonas Otitis Externa Detection Using Domain Adapted BERT Models (BERT)

Pseudomonas otitis externa (POE) is a painful and often chronic condition affecting dogs, associated with inflammation of ear canal and pinna. In this study will aim to leverage the large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRâ€™s) collected by the Small Animal Veterinary Surveillance Network (SAVSNET) to best understand the effect of breed, age and sex/neuter status as risk factors to causing POE. To achieve this, we introduce DogBERT, a species-level domain adapted BERT model trained on 3 million canine veterinary consults from UK veterinary practices.  DogBERT is further fine-tuned to create DogBERT-PC, a multi-class classifier for the detection of POE that achieves an F1-Score of 81% on all classes and 89% on positive cases. Statistical analysis of the data obtained by DogBERT-PC shows an increased risk of contracting POE with age and for breeds such as the Italian Spinone, Newfoundland and American Cocker Spaniel. Sex/neuter status was shown to have a little effect on risk compared to age and breed.  

This repo contains the code used to perform this study:
1 - DogBERT: Domain Adaptation of BERT-base-uncased using canine veterinary clinical notes
2 - Classifier Training: 3 seperate files used to train a binary classifier on balanced data, a binary classifier on unbalanced data and a multi-class classifier on unbalanced data
3 - Classifier Testing: Comparing the performance of the best 3 performing classifers in (2) on a 150 previously un-seen, manually labelled records
4 - Classification and Analysis of Records: Using the best performing classifer to classify records, then performing analysis on these records to determine breeds, ages and sex/neuter status combos most at risk of contracting POE
